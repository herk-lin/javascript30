      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80
      };

      // and think we make a copy:

      const captain = person;
      captain.age = 90;
      console.log(captain, person);

      // how do we take a copy instead?

      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 99 });
      console.log(cap2, person);

      const cap3 = { ...person };
      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
